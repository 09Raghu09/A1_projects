Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) is a prominent deep learning method for time series
prediction. LSTM is part of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In contrast to common feed-
forward networks where each layer is only connected to the subsequent layer.

The LSTM network is employed by using the python library keras. For the prediction, an LSTM of
the length of the training data with a simple 1-dense hidden-layer is created. The model itself is
optimized with adam and loss by the mean_squared_error.
