# Cluster Analysis

Performed a cluster analysis for the COVID-19 data set, which contains
roughly 60,000 articles and then applied dimensionality reduction using PCA and performed k-means
clustering. 

Subsequently, t-SNE is applied to project the original feature vector into two dimensions
such that clusters become visible in the two dimensional space.
In addition, two methods for selecting the best k value with two distance metrics were
compared: Silhouette Scoring vs Distortion and Euclidean vs Cosine Similarity.
