# Agent based Modelling

The aim of this project is to use agent-based simulation to model the interactions of individuals
within a population during the Covid-19 outbreak, so that one can determine how small changes
in behavior and interaction can affect population level output. Different extensions (incubation
and exposed state; chronic conditions and comorbidities; central locations) are implemented to
refine the model. In the end, the variability of human behaviour can be shown with the purpose to
understand the variability in the likely effectiveness of proposed interventions.
