# Origin Analysis

The determination of the most recent common ancestor of the human SARS-CoV-2
and the zoonotic transmission can provide important information about biological features, key
mutations and properties of the virus.

This project is based on Comparing the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with other viruses of the Coronaviridae
family in different hosts. Six complete genomes were considered, The sequence data (fasta files) were downloaded from the NCBI Virus public library.
