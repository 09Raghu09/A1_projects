# Multi-omics Data Preprocessing and Analysis

## Multi-omics data are collected from patients and analysed to create their individual molecular profiles (e,g, a single biomarker, a signature or changes in networks).
## These profiles can be used to match to disease profiles e.g. for diagnostics or to guide the selection of an optimal treatment (drug).
## This is achieved either through a match to known single biomarkers, or omics signatures or by analysing changes in networks/pathways.
