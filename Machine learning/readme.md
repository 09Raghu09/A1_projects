# Multi-omics Data Preprocessing and Analysis

Multi-omics data are collected from patients and analysed to create their individual molecular profiles (e,g, a single biomarker, a signature or changes in networks).
These profiles can be used to match to disease profiles e.g. for diagnostics or to guide the selection of an optimal treatment (drug).
This is achieved either through a match to known single biomarkers, or omics signatures or by analysing changes in networks/pathways.

Different methods used in biomarker discovery. 
(A) Differentially expressed method, 
(B) Machine learning method, 
(C) network-based method, 
(D) Differentially expressed, Neural network, Random forest, Decision tree, Genetic algorithm, Network-based stratification

Using biological knowledge discovery to interpret omics data and establish links to phenotypes and diseases.
