**Assignment 7, Team N**

## 1. Preprocess data
In order to first preprocess the data (found in */data/input/*), follow these steps:

1.Git clone the repository 

``` 
git clone https://git.imp.fu-berlin.de/mathiasw224/mlbi-2020.git 
```

or make sure that you are up to date with the repo: ``` git pull ``

2.Run the preprocessing script

``` 
python3 preprocessing.py
```
*You can decide which strategy you would prefer to use (default is bootstrapping) by changing the strategy in the
 main() of preprocessing.py to 'delete'*


## 2. Run ML models
The ML models that we implemented this week, can be found in each of the corresponding folders:
1. Random Forest Classifier (*/RF_classifier*)
1. Logistic Regression (*/LR_classifier*)
1. Gaussian Naive Bayes (*/NB_classifier*)

Each of these models has their own read me file, explaining how our results can be reproduced.
