## Linear regression jupyter notebook

Please find all needed packages, computational steps and results in the PDF export of the Jupyter Notebook we
 provide here: `Week_7_LR.py`
 
 The workflow and software dependencies are comparable to our RF classifier, yet the PDF export yields a nice
  overview of the workflow and corresponding results.
  If you are still interested in the executable Jupyter notebook, which unfortunately was not available in the moment
   of this commit, please don't hesitate to contact us (Team N) via Webex Teams or EMail.
